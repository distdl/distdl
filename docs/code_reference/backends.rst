Overview

Data Movement Backend Interface
===============================

Each back-end will is responsible for providing the concrete definitions of
partition classes and the functional interfaces for primitive data movement
layers.

Partitions
----------

Currently, two partition classes must be provided for a fully compatible
back-end: ``Partition`` for partitions with no topology and
``CartesianPartition`` for partitions with a Cartesian topology.

The partition classes serve as wrappers around the back-end data movement
tool's interface.  Implementations are free to make use of any back-end
specific API, but in general that API should not be explicitly exposed to
DistDL users.

The interfaces defined in these classes inherit a number of concepts from
the MPI back-end.  As DistDL evolves, it is anticipated that these interfaces
can become more generalized.

Partition interfaces are explicitly for distributed communication and data
movement, and as such they provide some interfaces for general parallel
communication concepts (e.g., broadcasts and all-gathers) for use other than
tensor data movement.  While much of the interface is inspired by MPI's API,
MPI-specific terminology is avoided, e.g., we use ``broadcast_data``, not
``bcast_data``.

Partitions with No Topology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     - :any:`Partition <distdl.backends.mpi.Partition>`

The partition with no topology, exposed from each back-end as ``Partition``,
is the general container for an unstructured team of workers.  It must provide
interfaces for creating teams of workers, creating sub-teams of workers,
creating unions of teams of workers, etc.

Regardless of back-end, a number of core partition concepts are to be exposed
by a basic unstructured partition:

* ``size``: The number of workers in the partition.
* ``rank``: The lexicographic identifier of the current worker.
* ``active``: The status of a worker in a partition.  An active member of a
  partition has the ability to communicate with other workers.
  An inactive member has no knowledge of the other workers and
  is entirely disconnected from the set of active workers.

For convenience, we also allow topology-free partitions to be treated as if
they are endowed with a 1-dimensional Cartesian topology.  Consequently,
they also have two further exposed concepts:

* ``shape``: Always a 1-iterable with containing `size` as the value.
* ``index``: Always the `rank`.


A partition must also provide the following API for creating new partitions:

* ``__init__()``: A partition is initialized using whatever back-end specific
  information is required to determine the above properties.
* ``create_partition_inclusive()``: Creates a subpartition of the current
  partition inclusive of a specified subset of workers.
* ``create_partition_union()``: Creates a new partition containing the union
  of the workers in two different partitions.  Workers calling instance are
  to be ordered before workers in the `other` instance and workers cannot
  be repeated.
* ``create_cartesian_topology_partition()``: Using the workers in the team
  for the unstructured partition, create a partition endowed with a
  Cartesian topology.
* ``create_allreduction_partition()``: Create the partition required to
  support the :ref:`All-sum-reduce
  <code_reference/nn/all_sum_reduce:AllSumReduce Layer>` operation.
* ``create_broadcast_partition_to()``: Following the DistDL
  :ref:`code_reference/nn/broadcast:Broadcast Rules`, create the sending and
  receiving partitions required to support the :ref:`Broadcast
  <code_reference/nn/broadcast:Broadcast Layer>` operation between two
  partitions.
* ``create_reduction_partition_to()``: Following the DistDL
  :ref:`code_reference/nn/broadcast:Broadcast Rules`, create the sending and
  receiving partitions required to support the :ref:`Sum-reduce
  <code_reference/nn/sum_reduce:SumReduce Layer>` operation between two
  partitions.

A partition must provide the following API for comparing partitions:

* ``__eq__()``: Comparison for strict equality.  This means the same team,
  ordered the same way.  If two partitions have similar structure, meaning the
  same size and shape but have different team members or organization, the are
  not equal.

A partition must provide the following API for communicating within partitions:

* ``broadcast_data()``: For sharing data from one worker to all workers in the
  partition.  This is distinct from the tensor broadcast operation.  This
  function does not require the receiving workers to have any knowledge of the
  structure of the data they are to receive.  Any information required to store
  this data (e.g., ``dtype`` or ``shape`` of an array) must be communicated in
  the function.

  This function supports two modes.  The first acts as a standard broadcast
  within a partition. The second allows data from one worker in a partition
  that is a *subpartition* of the calling partition to broadcast the data to
  the calling partition.  This is useful when the structure of the data is
  known only by workers on the subpartition but the data is needed on the
  superpartition.

* ``allgather_data()``: For sharing information on all workers in the partition
  with all other workers in the partition.


Partitions with Cartesian Topology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::

     - :any:`MPICartesianPartition <distdl.backends.mpi.partition.MPICartesianPartition>`
     - :any:`CartesianPartition <distdl.backends.mpi.CartesianPartition>`

Partitions endowed with a Cartesian topology are themselves partitions, with
additional ordering information that is useful, for example, when partitioning
a tensor.

In addition to the members required for
:ref:`code_reference/backends:Partitions with No Topology`, Cartesian
partitions also specify:

* ``shape``: An iterable giving the number of workers in each dimension.
* ``index``: An iterable with the lexicographic identifier of the worker in
  each dimension.

In addition to the API required for :ref:`code_reference/backends:Partitions
with No Topology`, Cartesian partitions must also specify:

* ``cartesian_index()``: A routine for obtaining the index of any worker
  in the partition, from its `rank`.
* ``neighbor_ranks()``: A routine for obtaining the ranks of neighboring
  workers in all dimensions of the partition.

In addition to the API required for :ref:`code_reference/backends:Partitions
with No Topology`, Cartesian partitions may also specify:

* ``create_cartesian_subtopology_partition()``: A routine for creating a
  subtopology, following the MPI subtopology specification.



Functional Primitives
---------------------

All Sum-Reduce
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :width: 100%
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left

   * - Back-end
     - Module
     - Class
   * - :ref:`MPI <code_reference/backends/mpi:MPI Backend>`

     - :any:`AllSumReduceFunction <distdl.backends.mpi.functional.AllSumReduceFunction>`

The functional primitive for the AllSumReduce data movement operation does not
use the original tensor partitions :math:`P_x` (input and output) directly.
Instead, the calling class must create new sub-partitions of :math:`P_x`,
along specified dimensions, to enable actual data movement.

For the AllSumReduce operation, these are back-end specific implementations of
:ref:`code_reference/backends:Partitions with No Topology` and the data
movement occurs *within* these partitions.

The forward AllSumReduce is equivalent to a standard SumReduce followed by
a standard Broadcast, though the actual implementation will rarely use
these routines directly.

The sub-partitions are created using the ``create_allreduce_partition()``
method of the ``Partition`` class for the selected back-end, which
creates a number of partitions equal to the product the dimensions
of :math:`P_x` which are *not* reduced in the reduction.

Each worker in :math:`P_x` is a member of exactly one of these sub-partitions.

We illustrate some examples of the construction of these partitions in the
following example.  Consider a :math:`2 \times 3 \times 2` input
partition :math:`P_x`, as illustrated below, where workers are identified a
*global* lexicographic ordering.  For example, in an MPI-based environment,
this would mean the identifiers are the ranks in a group of size 12 that is
a parent group to both partitions.

.. note::
    Implementations should not impose anything on the ordering of the workers.
    Back-end specific (private) routines may be used to map indices to workers.

    :alt: Image of 2x3x2 partition with labeled workers.

    Caption here.


If the reduction is specified over the 0th and 2nd dimensions, then this
broadcast creates 3 partitions as described above, illustrated below, which
we label :math:`P_0`, :math:`P_1`, and :math:`P_2` for convenience.


.. figure:: /_images/all_sum_reduce_example_A02.png

The following table gives the global lexicographic identifiers of each worker
in the partition.

   * - :math:`P_1`
     - 2, 3, 8, 9
   * - :math:`P_2`
     - 4, 5, 10, 11

After the forward application of the all-sum-reduction, all workers active in the
``P_x`` partition have as output the sum reduction of the correct subtensors of the
original tensor.

.. figure:: /_images/all_sum_reduce_example_A03.png
    :alt: Image of 1x3x1 to 2x3x2 all-sum-reductin along dimensions 0 and 2.

    Completed all-sum-reduction.

AllSumReduce may apply over any combination of the dimensions, including all
and none of them.  If all dimensions of the partition are included, the output
is the sum over all input tensors in the partition.  If the set of input
dimensions is empty, then the layer is functionally the identity.

The adjoint phase works the same way, as this operation is self-adjoint, as 
described in the `motivating paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03108>`_.

Broadcast
~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::

     - :any:`BroadcastFunction <distdl.backends.mpi.functional.BroadcastFunction>`

The functional primitive for the Broadcast data movement operation does not
use the original tensor partitions :math:`P_x` (input) and :math:`P_y`
(output) directly.  Instead, the calling class must create two new partitions
to enable actual data movement.

For the Broadcast operation, these are back-end specific implementations of
:ref:`code_reference/backends:Partitions with No Topology` and the data
movement occurs *within* these partitions.

The partitions are created using the ``create_broadcast_partition_to()``
method of the ``Partition`` class for the selected back-end, which creates a
number of partitions equal to the product of the shape of :math:`P_x`.

Each of these partitions has, as its root, the worker that is the source of
the data to be copied in the broadcast and all other workers in the partition
are to receive those copies.  The root is specified in a back-end specific
manner, e.g., the first worker in the partition is the 0th rank in the
associated group of processors in the MPI back-end implementation.

Each worker in :math:`P_x` or :math:`P_y` has access to up to two of these
partitions.  If the worker is active in :math:`P_x` it will have a non-null
``P_send`` partition, which it is the root worker of.  If it is active in
:math:`P_y`, it will have a non-null ``P_recv`` partition.  Usually, the
worker will be a non-root worker in ``P_recv``, indicating that it is going to
receive a copy from the root.  However, it is possible that the worker *may be
the root of* ``P_recv``.  This occurs if ``P_send`` and ``P_recv`` are the
same and thus the worker is required to copy its own data to itself as part of
the broadcast.

We illustrate some examples of the construction of these partitions in the
following example.  Consider a broadcast of a tensor partitioned by a :math:`1
\times 3 \times 1` partition :math:`P_x` to :math:`2 \times 3 \times 2`
partition :math:`P_y`, as illustrated below, where workers are identified a
*global* lexicographic ordering.  For example, in an MPI-based environment,
this would mean the identifiers are the ranks in a group of size 12 that is a
parent group to both partitions.

.. note::
    Implementations should not impose anything on the ordering of the workers
    in :math:`P_x` and :math:`P_y`.  The sets of workers in these partitions
    may be disjoint, partially overlapping, or completely overlapping.


.. figure:: /_images/broadcast_example_A01.png
    :alt: Image of 1x3x1 to 2x3x1 broadcast with labeled workers.

    Blue, yellow, and red subtensors on :math:`P_x` are to be broadcast to
    :math:`P_y`.  Labels on subtensors are global lexicographic identifiers
    for the workers.


This broadcast creates 3 partitions as described above, illustrated below, which we
label :math:`P_0`, :math:`P_1`, and :math:`P_2` for convenience.

This example illustrates the case where a worker needs to broadcast to itself
as root (workers 1 and 2), the case where a worker broadcasts from itself as
root and receives data in another partition (worker 3), and the case where a
worker simply receives copies of the data from the roots (workers 0 and 4-11).
It also illustrates that the root worker is the one that has the data, not the
lowest globally ranked worker (e.g., in :math:`P_0`).

After the forward application of the broadcast, all workers active in a
``P_recv`` partition have as output a copy of the correct subtensor of the
original tensor.

The adjoint phase works the same way, but in reverse.  However, as
demonstrated in the `motivating paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03108>`_,
the subtensors on :math:`P_y` are sum-reduced back to :math:`P_x`, rather than
copied.

The functional primitive for the SumReduce data movement operation does not
use the original tensor partitions :math:`P_x` (input) and :math:`P_y`
(output) directly.  Instead, the calling class must create two new partitions
to enable actual data movement.

For the sum-reduce operation, these are back-end specific implementations of
:ref:`code_reference/backends:Partitions with No Topology` and the data
movement occurs *within* these partitions.

The partitions are created using the ``create_reduction_partition_to()``
method of the ``Partition`` class for the selected back-end, which creates a
number of partitions equal to the product of the shape of :math:`P_y`.

Each of these partitions has, as its root, the worker that is the destination of
the data to be reduced in the sum-reduction and all other workers in the partition
are the sources of that data.  The root is specified in a back-end specific
manner, e.g., the first worker in the partition is the 0th rank in the
associated group of processors in the MPI back-end implementation.

Each worker in :math:`P_x` or :math:`P_y` has access to up to two of these
partitions.  If the worker is active in :math:`P_x` it will have a non-null
``P_send`` partition.  If it is active in :math:`P_y`, it will have a non-null
``P_recv`` partition, which it is the root worker of.  Usually, the worker
will be a non-root worker in ``P_send``, indicating that it is going to send
partial sums to the root.  However, it is possible that the worker *may be the
root of* ``P_recv``.  This occurs if ``P_send`` and ``P_recv`` are the same
and thus the worker also contributes its own data to its reduction.

We illustrate some examples of the construction of these partitions in the
following example.  Consider a sum-reduction of a tensor partitioned by a
:math:`2 \times 3 \times 2` partition :math:`P_x` to :math:`1 \times 3 \times
1` partition :math:`P_y`, as illustrated below, where workers are identified a
*global* lexicographic ordering.  For example, in an MPI-based environment,
this would mean the identifiers are the ranks in a group of size 12 that is a
parent group to both partitions.

.. note::
    Implementations should not impose anything on the ordering of the workers
    in :math:`P_x` and :math:`P_y`.  The sets of workers in these partitions
    may be disjoint, partially overlapping, or completely overlapping.

This example illustrates the case where a worker needs to sum-reduce to itself
as root (workers 1 and 2), the case where a worker sum-reduces from itself as
root and receives data in another partition (worker 3), and the case where a
worker simply contributes data to the reduction (workers 0 and 4-11).
It also illustrates that the root worker is the one that has the data, not the
lowest globally ranked worker (e.g., in :math:`P_0`).

After the forward application of the sum-reduction, all workers active in a
``P_recv`` partition  have as output the sum-reduction of the appropriate
subtensors of the original tensor.

The adjoint phase works the same way, but in reverse.  However, as
demonstrated in the `motivating paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03108>`_,
the subtensors on :math:`P_y` are broadcast back to :math:`P_x`, rather than
sum-reduced.

The functional primitive for the Transpose data movement operation does not
use the original tensor partitions :math:`P_x` (input) and :math:`P_y`
(output) directly.  Instead, the calling class creates a new union partition,
within which data is moved.

Within this union, workers either share data with other workers, receive
shared data from other workers, or keep subsets of their own data.  All
sharing of data occurs through intermediate buffers.

.. note::
   These buffers are allocated by the calling class, using a helper function
   that must be specified by the back-end.

The calling class provides two sets of meta information and buffers, one for
any sending and one for any receiving a worker has to do.  The meta
information is a triplet, ``(slice, size, partner)``.  When the worker must
send data, ``slice`` is a Python ``Slice`` object describing the indices of
the input tensor that it must copy to worker ``partner``.  ``size`` is the
volume of ``slice`` and ``partner`` is the lexicographic identifier (or rank)
of the partner worker.  The associated send buffer will be of size ``size``,
specified in records, not bytes.  Meta information for the receive is
essentially the same, except ``slice`` describes the slice of the output
tensor the data will go to and ``partner`` is the source the data.

While most operations can be completed using information about the local
subtensor only, this operation requires the global input tensor size.  This is
because we do not require the global tensor size to be specified when the
layer is instantiated.  Instead, the layer determines that size when it is
called.  Consequently, the shape of the local output subtensor tensor cannot
be known until then, either.

A worker may be part of either :math:`P_x`, :math:`P_y`, or both. If it is
part of :math:`P_x`, then it will only need to share parts of its local input
subtensor with other workers.  If it is not part of :math:`P_x`, it will take
a zero-volume tensor as input.  If it is part of :math:`P_y`, its output
subtensor will be formed by receiving copies of parts of other workers' local
input subtensors.  If it is not part of :math:`P_y`, then its output will be a
zero-volume tensor. If a worker is part of both, its output may be a direct
copy of part of its own input.

The adjoint phase works the same way, but in reverse.  However, as
demonstrated in the `motivating paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03108>`_,
the subtensors on :math:`P_y` are summed back to :math:`P_x`, rather than
copied.  However, because there are no overlaps in the local scatters, this
sum can safely be replaced with a copy.
